## Summary
Chlorine is the easiest way to interact with [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) compatible devices. It is a header-only `C++11` library that allows you to write cross-platform code that runs on GPUs without ever touching the complicated OpenCL API, leaving you free to write code that matters: kernels that process data.

## Getting Started
Chlorine is composed of just two headers: [chlorine.hpp](https://github.com/Polytonic/Chlorine/blob/master/chlorine/include/chlorine.hpp), and its dependency, the [OpenCL C++ Bindings](https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/). To integrate Chlorine into your own project, [install OpenCL](https://github.com/Polytonic/Chlorine/blob/master/build/readme.md); then add `chlorine/include` to your include paths and link with OpenCL. Chlorine also requires a compiler with `C++11` support. An example of how to use Chlorine is below, or read a more detailed [walkthrough](https://github.com/Polytonic/Chlorine/tree/master/examples/swap) if you prefer.

**main.cpp**
```c++
std::vector<float> data(10, 3.1415f);        // Create Some Sample Data
ch::Worker worker("kernel.cl");              // Initialize a Chlorine Worker
auto event = worker.call("square", data);    // Call Kernel Square Function
std::cout << "Data: " << data[0] << "\n";    // Prints 9.8696; Like Magic!

// Print Some Profiling Data
std::cout << "Elapsed Time: " << ch::elapsed(event) << "ns\n";
```
**kernel.cl**
```c
__kernel void square(__global float * data) {
    unsigned int i = get_global_id(0);
    data[i] = data[i] * data[i];
}
```

If you're looking to compile the examples or just want to play around in the sandbox project, follow these steps! Chlorine uses the [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) build system, which is used to generate platform-specific makefiles or project files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Polytonic/Chlorine
cd Chlorine
cd build
```

Now generate a project file or makefile for your platform. If you want to use a particular IDE, make sure it is installed; don't forget to set the Start-Up Project in Visual Studio or the Target in Xcode.

```bash
# UNIX Makefile
cmake ..

# Mac OSX
cmake -G "Xcode" ..

# Microsoft Windows
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14" ..
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" ..
...
```

To run tests, you will need to pull down the test framework, then call the right test script.

```bash
git submodule update --init
make check # UNIX
make_check # Windows
```

## Documentation
Chlorine focuses on making OpenCL frictionless; you should *work with your data*, not wrangle with an API. Chlorine offers a non-invasive approach to integrating parallel programming into your code through a magic method `::call(...)` which accepts any number of arguments (of any type). Arguments to `::call(...)` are automagically mapped in the order they are passed, to parameters of the indicated kernel function, and data is transferred back when the kernel function finishes. This is achieved through the use of [variadic templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_template) to support the following types:

 - [Arithmetic Scalar Types](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/type_traits/is_arithmetic/)
 - [OpenCL Vector Types](https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/vectorDataTypes.html)
 - [C-Style Arrays](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/)
 - [STL Arrays](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/)
 - [STL Valarrays](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/valarray/)
 - [STL Vectors](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)

The class declaration is useful as a quick API reference, and all method implementations in Chlorine should have annotations. If you want a more sophisticated API reference, you can use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) to generate the HTML documentation.

For convenience, Chlorine also provides a simple version of `clinfo`, allowing you to print basic information about OpenCL devices on your computer. You can build it using `cmake`.

Note that kernels may not automatically perform type promotion. When working with floating point numbers, be sure to use the appropriate literal. For instance, `3.14` vs. `3.14f`.
